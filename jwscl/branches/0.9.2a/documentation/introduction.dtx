<b>JEDI Windows Security Library BETA</b> This is the preliminary version of
JWSCL.

The suite is a bunch of classes that encapsulated MS Windows security functions
in object oriented way.

The goal of this project is to make security programming easier to delphi
programmers. This includes that the programmer must not allocate Windows API
memory and also free it. Furthermore she can use simple Delphi String (Ansi- and
WideString) in all function that needs string manipulation. The memory
allocation and deallocation for these things is done internally with a content
check. Of course it is possible to retrieve winapi structures easily to use in
other winapi calls (e.g. <link TJwSecurityDescriptor>.<link TJwSecurityDescriptor.Create_SD@Cardinal@boolean, Create_SD>).
The caller also has to free it using a counter part function (e.g. <link TJwSecurityDescriptor>.<link TJwSecurityDescriptor.Free_SD@PSecurityDescriptor, Free_SD>).

Also api functions are wrapped together in classes to diminish initialization
that consumes a great amount of time which (s)he could use for better things.
All the programmer has to do is to free the class instance after she has used
it.

<b>However it is not the goal to teach Delphi programmers how to program in
windows security or create secure windows applications</b>. The programmer has
to understand the security of windows by herself. To use these classes she must
know what tokens, principals, secure objects, sessions and so on are.

On the other hand if you want to test the software by creating good test
scenarios (module, function, class, integration testing) you are welcome. With
good tests I mean tests that are reproducable, have a high function cover and
uses DUnit.

<b>This library has beta status and is surely not bug free.</b>
