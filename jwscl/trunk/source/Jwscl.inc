If this definition is set and the application is compiled with
static linked jwaVista.pas the binary application will fail
on pre Vista Windows versions!!

Warning: Unsetting this value will not remove constructor, method and property
definitions created for Windows Vista. It only removes function calls
so that static linked apps will not fail immediately on pre Vista systems.
Of course they will fail if Vista stuff is called on them.
